**Contributions**

•Theoretically: we provide finite-sample generalization bounds for Semi-DA on both classification and regression problems. Our bounds inform new directions for simultaneously **optimizing** **both marginal** **and conditional distributions** across domains for better generalization on the target.

•In practice: we propose a bound minimization algorithm, LIRR, to **jointly learn** **invariant representations** **and invariant optimal predictors**, in order to mitigate the accuracy discrepancy across domains for better generalizations.
