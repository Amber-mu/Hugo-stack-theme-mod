>1 Maximize Variance

the goal is to find the orthogonal projection of the data into a lower dimensional linear space such that the variance of the projected data is maximised .

>2 Minimum Error

PCA is defined as the linear projection that minimises the average projection cost (mean squared error) between the data points and their projection .
